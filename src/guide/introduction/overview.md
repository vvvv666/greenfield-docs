# Overview

## What is BNB Greenfield
BNB Greenfield is an innovative blockchain and storage platform that seeks to unleash the power of decentralized
technology on data ownership and the data economy. With a focus on facilitating decentralized data management and
access, Greenfield aims to revolutionize the data economy by easing the storing and management of data and linking
data ownership with the DeFi context of BNB Smart Chain (BSC).

What sets Greenfield apart from existing centralized and decentralized storage systems are its three key components:

- It allows Ethereum-compatible addresses to create and manage both data and token assets.

- It natively links data permissions and management logic onto BSC as exchangeable assets and smart contract programs
 with all other assets.

- It provides developers with similar API primitives and performance as popular existing Web2 cloud storage.

The ultimate goal of Greenfield is to establish a test field for new data economy and dApp models, which will
undoubtedly aid in the development and evolution of the foundation for Web3.

## How BNB Greenfield Works

BNB Greenfield operates on two layers:

1. It is built on a new, storage-focused blockchain; and

2. It consists of a network of "storage providers".

The [BNB Greenfield Blockchain](../greenfield-blockchain/overview.md) maintains the ledger for
users and records the storage metadata as the common blockchain state data. Its native token for gas and governance is
BNB, which is transferred from BNB Smart Chain. Additionally, BNB Greenfield blockchain has its own staking logic
designed for governance.

The [Storage Providers (SP)](../storage-provider/overview.md) are storage service infrastructures
provided by organizations or individuals that use Greenfield as the ledger and the single source of truth. Each SP is
responsible for responding to user requests to upload and download data, while also serving as the gatekeeper for user
rights and authentications.

Together, BNB Greenfield blockchain and the SPs comprise a decentralized object storage system that serves as the core
of this new economy. Developers can construct decentralized applications (dApps) using the BNB Greenfield platform,
which can act as client tools that facilitate user interactions with Greenfield; or applications that provide significant
value to users' real lives using Greenfield as their infrastructure. These applications will use blockchain addresses
as user identifiers and connect with features and smart contracts on the Greenfield blockchain, Greenfield SPs, and BSC.

A native cross-chain bridge exists between BSC and BNB Greenfield blockchain. While it is cheaper to create and access
data on Greenfield, the relevant data operation can be transferred to BSC and integrated with DeFi smart contract
systems to generate new business models.

## Why BNB Greenfield

The cryptocurrency industry has experienced significant growth and adoption, with the likes of tokens, stablecoins, and
DeFi covering various economic scenarios. However, certain areas like credit, real-world asset (RWA) tokenizations,
and data remain inadequately innovated. Consequently, BNB Greenfield has been created to focus on ***data***.

A crucial issue that the BNB Greenfield project aims to address is that the value of a data asset is not self-evident
when held by one person. The value of data assets increases when shared and leveraged by multiple parties, which stems
from the ability to write, read, grant rights for sharing data, and even execute data to generate another. These
abilities have financial traits that are tradable, and such trades can produce even more value and benefit two parties
rather than just one.

We foresee the need to create a new Web3 infrastructure for data, as two major features are still missing: 
a performant, convenient, and friendly decentralized storage infra, and the data-focused smart contract synergy.
Hence, we aim to create "BNB Greenfield," a new BNB side blockchain and relevant infrastructure that allows users and
developers to:

1. "login" with anonymous cryptographic-based keys (IDs);

2. create, read, share, and even execute data, with a user experience that is on par with the state-of-the-art cloud
   storage services today, and at a low cost;

3. fully own their data assets and control who can use them and how;

4. easily put their data assets into a wide, smart-contract-based economic context to gain financial value with them.

In summary, BNB Greenfield seeks to offer users greater freedom in creating, owning, sharing, executing, and trading
their data assets, while also providing transparency on how their data is owned and used.
